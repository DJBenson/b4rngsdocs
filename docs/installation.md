# Installation
One of the most frequent questions we get asked is "what will the impact on my property be". They say a picture says a thousand words and in keeping with that sentiment, we have collated a number of photos of installs done in neighbouring Bolton-by-Bowland whose project went live recently. I'm sure you'll agree the B4RN installers do a great job of hiding the work they did to install the equipment with only minimal signs that the property even has B4RN.
