# Grindleton and Sawley project moves into build phase - a message from David Ryall, B4RN Volunteer and Development Manager

As you may know, we have been in the final stages of planning the Grindleton and Sawley B4RN broadband rollout.

I’m very pleased to update you that today we held the internal handover meeting which formally approves to project to move into the construction phase.

If you are someone who wants the service, there will be updates and communication about timescales to connect various parts of the network. You will also be contacted when we are getting close to you to discuss the detail of the plan for your property.

If you are a landowner who has granted us wayleaves, we’ll be contacting you as we progress to discuss precise routes and any other details we’ll need, and answer any questions you may have.

If you have pledged to invest, our Shares Administrator will be contacting you via email to explain the process of converting your pledge to a share purchase.

Those taking service, granting wayleaves, and investing are all vital to the project so a big thankyou to you all.

I’d also like to take this opportunity to thank your local volunteer team who have devoted over a year of their lives to getting the project off the ground. Your area will benefit greatly from this and it’s a real, legacy for them and you. Congratulations!

**David Ryall**
