# Grindleton is live!

After many months of hard work by B4RN, their subcontractors and the volunteer team, the first connections have gone line in the Grindleton and Sawley project.

At the time of posting, over 40 premises are now live and enjoying ultra fast gigabit broadband in the village. One of the connected premises is Grindleton Pavilion which will now allow visitors access to fast, reliable internet via the guest Wi-Fi service.

Work is continuing at pace on the infrastructure project to connect Sawley and the rest of Grindleton and the volunteers are still on the ground conducting house installs ready for go-live.
