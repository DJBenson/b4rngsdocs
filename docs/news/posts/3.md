# Cross-village maildrop delivers hundreds of leaflets

Over the course of the weekend of the 19th of October, volunteers from the Grindleton and Sawley project have been out in force hand-delivering an important message to villagers in both Grindleton and Sawley. You will have seen our [previous](2.md) announcement regarding the project, but we received feedback that not all potential users had access to social media (and as such would not know about this website) we we have delivered hundreds of copies of the announcement along with a pledge form to customers doors.

A copy of the announcement can be found [here](/uploads/b4rngs_maildrop_oct24.pdf).
