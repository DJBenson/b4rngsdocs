# FAQs: Frequently Asked Questions

We have collated answers to some of the most popular questions we get - if you have a question which isn't listed here then feel free to [Contact us](contact.md) and we'll do our best to help. This guide is collated and supported by B4RN volunteers and not B4RN themselves.

B4RN also have an official FAQ on their website [here](https://b4rn.org.uk/support/faqs). Please do check whether your question has already been answered by either of the FAQs and if not, you are more than welcome to [Contact us](contact.md).

## Why do I need B4RN?
There are many reasons why B4RN is a good choice for your broadband service and we've highlighted a couple of them as part of this FAQ;

* **Affordable Pricing**: B4RN costs £33 per month, with no extra line rental fees. They also offer a lower-priced option at £15 per month for those who get council tax assistance, making fast internet more accessible.

* **Super Fast Speeds**: B4RN provides very fast internet. While you might not need this speed right now, more services are moving online, and the demand for faster connections is growing. For example, TV networks may switch entirely to online streaming in the future, so having a fast connection will become more important.

* **Reliable Network**: Unlike other providers that use old phone lines (which often break and have slower speeds), B4RN uses a full-fiber network designed to be future-proof. This means you get a stable, fast internet connection now and in the years to come.

* **Community-Focused**: B4RN is run for the benefit of the community. Any profits go back into improving the network or helping local projects, rather than paying shareholders. Local volunteers often help with the installation, creating a sense of community involvement.

* **Adds Property Value**: A full-fiber connection can make your property more appealing to buyers since many people now see fast, reliable internet as essential.
 
In short, B4RN offers an affordable, fast, and future-proof internet service that benefits both you and the community.

## My current broadband is good enough

While your current broadband might seem "good enough" for now, having a fast and reliable internet connection will become increasingly important in the future. For example, companies like Sky are starting to offer TV services through the internet, which might replace the need for satellite dishes. Similarly, Freeview has launched "Freely," which lets you watch TV over the internet instead of using an aerial.

Phone services are also changing. BT is switching customers from old phone lines to a system called Voice over IP (VoIP), which means phone calls are made through the internet. Fast broadband, like the service B4RN offers, can support this transition while also allowing you to keep your current phone number.

As more services move online, the need for faster internet will grow. With B4RN's gigabit speed, you’ll be ready for whatever comes next. This faster connection has many benefits, including:

* **Streaming TV**: Services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, BBC iPlayer, and Disney+ require a certain level of speed to work smoothly.
* **Video Calls**: You can have clearer, more reliable video calls with family and friends using FaceTime or Zoom.
* **Uploading and Downloading**: It makes sharing photos, videos, and downloading music much quicker.
* **Multiple Devices**: You can use several devices at once without slowing down your connection.
* **Working from Home**: Enjoy smoother video meetings and faster access to large files when working remotely.

In short, upgrading to a faster service like B4RN’s gigabit broadband will ensure you’re prepared for all the new internet-based services coming your way.

## I already have "fiber optic broadband" - why do I need B4RN?

Some internet providers use tricky language when they say they offer "fiber optic broadband." In places like Grindleton and Sawley, fiber optic cables bring the internet to green boxes (street cabinets) in the village. However, from those boxes to your home, the internet travels through old copper wires or overhead poles. This part of the network slows down your internet speed. This setup is called "fiber to the cabinet" (FTTC).

B4RN provides a “full fiber” service, which means it brings the internet directly into your home using special fiber optic cables. Unlike other providers that still use older copper phone lines, this method avoids common problems like slow speeds. This type of connection is often called "fiber to the home" (FTTH) or "fiber to the premise" (FTTP).

## What equipment gets installed at my property?

B4RN will install a small box on the outside wall of your house. This box is known as a CCE – Customer Connection Enclosure, it's basically the point where your home connects to the B4RN network. They will drill a small hole in the wall to connect this box to the inside of your home.

Inside your home, a socket is installed, similar to a "master socket" (known as a FWO – Fibre Wall Outlet)  where you plug in the B4RN router. This router then provides you with a WiFi signal and has sockets on the back for plugging in other devices like computers.

The B4RN installers will work with you to place this equipment in the best spot, making sure to minimize any disruption.

## What options are there for a new email provider?
It's usually a good idea to use an email provider that isn't connected to your internet company. This way, if you ever change your internet provider, you won't lose access to your email. There are many free and reliable email services you can use, such as Gmail or Outlook, which you can set up quickly and start using right away. A few suggestions include...

* [GMail / Google Mail](https://gmail.google.com) - 15 GB of free storage and access to a host of other free services including calendar, photos and file storage.
* [Outlook (Microsoft)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/outlook/email-and-calendar-software-microsoft-outlook) - 15 GB of free storage, integration with Microsoft Office, calendar, to-do and other Office Web Apps.
* [Yahoo! Mail](https://mail.yahoo.co.uk) - 1 TB of free storage, calendar and contacts.

All of the above are free, easy to set up and you can check your email on the web or configure your phone or tablet to automatically download your email.

## Can I move my email from my current provider to one of the providers listed above?

Yes - this is possible using a service such as [ImapSync](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/X/) but it's beyond the scope of this FAQ. We can help you with this process if you want to move all your email from your current provider to a new one (for example from Sky to GMail). [Contact us](contact.md) for further information.

## What about telephone? Can I have a landline?

Unlike legacy providers who currently provide services to Grindleton and Sawley, B4RN's network is full fiber, which means there is no copper telephone line. That doesn't mean you cannot have a "landline" telephone number though. It is possible to transmit voice over the fiber optic network using a technology called VoIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol). A small adapter connects your existing telephone to the B4RN network and from that point onwards the phone works like it always did. B4RN have their own service called "B4RN Voice" but there are other options available should you wish to explore options. You can find out more about B4RN Voice [here](https://b4rn.org.uk/support/b4rn-voice-faqs).

[Back to Top](#faqs-frequently-asked-questions)

## Can I keep my number?

If you choose B4RN Voice then yes - there is a small cost and some things you must do to ensure the transfer goes smootly. You can find out more about B4RN Voice [here](https://b4rn.org.uk/support/b4rn-voice-faqs).

For other providers, it may be possible to keep your number. Double-check with the provider before you switch.

## I Have Sky Q / Sky Glass / Sky Stream - will this still work?

Yes, you can use Sky's TV services without having Sky Broadband. Before switching to another broadband provider like B4RN, check if you're still in a contract for your current broadband or if it's bundled with your TV package. If it is bundled, you'll need to contact Sky to cancel just the broadband. Also, there are minimum speed requirements for Sky's TV services, but with B4RN's gigabit connection, this won't be an issue!

## I have BT mesh "discs" - will these still work?

If you have the newer black discs, they will only work with the BT HomeHub router. The older white discs are more flexible—they can be used with any internet provider and connect easily to the B4RN router using a standard Ethernet cable. The reason the newer black discs are limited is that they are designed to work as part of a system with the BT router, so they can't be used with other routers.

## I have a mesh system / repeater / extender I bought myself - will these still work?

Most devices from other companies are made to work with any internet provider. They can either plug into the B4RN router using an Ethernet cable (a common internet cable) or connect to the B4RN router's Wi-Fi to boost the signal. If you're unsure if your equipment will work, feel free to [Contact us](contact.md), and we’ll be happy to help.

It's important that any third party equipment, including mesh systems, are set up correctly or there can be issues. We will provide support for such setups wherever possible.

## I have specialst / industry-specific equipment connected to my existing broadband - will this still work?

The short answer is "probably". It depends on how the equipment connects but if it's by cable (ethernet) or wifi then there is no reason at all why it would not work with the B4RN-provided router.
