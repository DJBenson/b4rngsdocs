## About B4RN
B4RN (Broadband for the Rural North) is a community-led broadband provider in the UK that brings high-speed fiber optic internet to rural areas. It was founded to address the lack of reliable internet in remote, underserved regions where commercial providers typically don't invest. B4RN offers gigabit-speed connections, providing one of the fastest broadband services in the country. 

The service is run by volunteers and local communities, who help install the network by digging trenches for the fiber cables, often across private land. B4RN operates as a not-for-profit social enterprise, reinvesting profits to expand its network to more rural areas. This model allows residents of rural communities to gain access to affordable, high-quality internet, improving connectivity for households, businesses, and public services like schools.
