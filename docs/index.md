# Grindleton & Sawley Project Hub

## Welcome
Welcome to the Grindleton & Sawley Project Hub. This is a volunteer-led project which aims to spread the word about B4RN, how it can improve our digital lives and the investment opporunities available which allow B4RN to deliver their services where it might otherwise be deemed not economically viable. 

Please feel free to browse the site and if you have any questions, you can [contact](contact.md) us for further information.
