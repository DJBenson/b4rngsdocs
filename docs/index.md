Please read our important announcement about the Grindleton and Sawley project [here](news/posts/2.md). We **NEED** your support to deliver ultra-fast, ultra-reliable broadband to the area. Bolton-by-Bowland have achieved it so there's no reason we can't do the same.
## Welcome
Welcome to the B4RN Grindleton & Sawley Support Site. This is a volunteer-led project which aims to spread the word about B4RN, how it can improve our digital lives and the investment opporunities available.

This site is neither operated nor endorsed by B4RN but our volunteers work closely with B4RN to ensure we provide accurate and relevant information to potential B4RN customers and/or investors.

Please feel free to browse the site and if you have any questions, you can [contact](contact.md) us for further information.
