They also offer a lower-priced option at \u00a315 per month for those who get council tax assistance, making fast internet more accessible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Super Fast Speeds: B4RN provides very fast internet. While you might not need this speed right now, more services are moving online, and the demand for faster connections is growing. For example, TV networks may switch entirely to online streaming in the future, so having a fast connection will become more important.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reliable Network: Unlike other providers that use old phone lines (which often break and have slower speeds), B4RN uses a full-fiber network designed to be future-proof. This means you get a stable, fast internet connection now and in the years to come.</p> </li> <li> <p>Community-Focused: B4RN is run for the benefit of the community. Any profits go back into improving the network or helping local projects, rather than paying shareholders. Local volunteers often help with the installation, creating a sense of community involvement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adds Property Value: A full-fiber connection can make your property more appealing to buyers since many people now see fast, reliable internet as essential.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In short, B4RN offers an affordable, fast, and future-proof internet service that benefits both you and the community.</p> <p>Back to Top</p>"},{"location":"faqs/#my-current-broadband-is-good-enough","title":"My current broadband is good enough","text":"<p>While your current broadband might seem \"good enough\" for now, having a fast and reliable internet connection will become increasingly important in the future.

Similarly, Freeview has launched \"Freely,\" which lets you watch TV over the internet instead of using an aerial.</p> <p>Phone services are also changing. BT is switching customers from old phone lines to a system called Voice over IP (VoIP), which means phone calls are made through the internet. Fast broadband, like the service B4RN offers, can support this transition while also allowing you to keep your current phone number.</p> <p>As more services move online, the need for faster internet will grow.

To avoid this, using a battery backup device called a UPS (\"Uninterruptable Power Supply\") can be purchased separately and installed between the power outlet on the wall and your B4RN router. </p> <p>These devices are fairly inexpensive (around \u00a360) and easy to set up, and will offer peace of mind if there happens to be a powercut (and will protect the router in case of short interruptions to the supply which would normally cause the router to reboot).</p> <p>The below is based on personal experience of one device, others are available (see the table at the bottom of the article) but their operation and how they are set up is almost identical regardless of brand.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/ups/#ske-mini-ups-10400mah-battery-2x12v-outputs-1x9v-output-1x5v-usb-a-output","title":"SKE Mini UPS (10400mAh battery, 2x12v outputs, 1x9v output, 1x5v USB-A output)","text":"Store Price Amazon.co.uk \u00a365.99 * <ul> <li>Currently on offer with 35% off making it \u00a342.89</li> </ul> Click on the images below to enlage"},{"location":"tutorials/ups/#other-options-not-tested-by-the-author-but-work-the-same-as-the-above","title":"Other options (not tested by the author but work the same as the above)","text":"Item Store Price APC Back-UPS Connect Amazon.co.uk \u00a359.33 Eaton 3S Mini UPS Amazon.co.uk \u00a353.99 Mini UPS Portable Amazon.co.uk \u00a338.99 <p>Prices and links correct at the time of publishing.</p>"},{"location":"uploads/","title":"Index","text":"<p>Uploads folder</p>"},{"location":"news/archive/2025-06/","title":"June 2025","text":""},{"location":"news/archive/2025-02/","title":"February 2025","text":""},{"location":"news/archive/2025-01/","title":"January 2025","text":""},{"location":"news/archive/2024-10/","title":"October 2024","text":""},{"location":"news/page/2/","title":"Latest News","text":""}]}
